# PIL
Python Imaging Library is a popular library in Python used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. It provides extensive support for image processing tasks and is widely used for tasks such as image resizing, cropping, and filtering. The PIL library is no longer maintained, and its current active fork is the Pillow library, which is an actively maintained and improved version of PIL.

## Here are some key features and functionalities of the PIL/Pillow library:

##Image Handling
PIL/Pillow allows users to easily open and load images from various file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, and TIFF. It provides methods to create new images, work with existing images, and save images to different file formats.

## Image Manipulation
The library offers a wide range of image manipulation capabilities, including but not limited to resizing, cropping, rotating, and flipping images. Additionally, it allows for basic image enhancement operations such as adjusting brightness, contrast, and sharpness.

## Image Filtering
PIL/Pillow provides various filters that can be applied to images, such as blurring, contouring, edge enhancement, and embossing. These filters help enhance the quality and appearance of images and are widely used in image processing applications.

## Image Drawing
The library enables users to draw simple shapes and text on images. It supports drawing lines, rectangles, circles, and text with custom fonts and colors, allowing for the creation of annotations or custom visual elements on images.

## Image Conversion
PIL/Pillow facilitates the conversion of images between different modes, such as RGB, CMYK, and grayscale. It also provides tools for converting images to black and white and for applying color palettes to images.

## Image Saving
The library supports saving processed images in various file formats. Users can easily save images in formats such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP, among others.

### PIL/Pillow is a versatile library that simplifies the process of working with images in Python. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, scientific research, and image processing applications. With its user-friendly interface and rich set of functionalities, it is a valuable tool for both beginners and experienced developers working with images in Python.
