# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
The K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm is a versatile and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates based on the idea that data points with similar features tend to have similar labels. In K-NN, "K" represents the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making a prediction. This algorithm is non-parametric, which means it doesn't make strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

## In this repository, we provide a Python implementation of the K-NN algorithm. This implementation is well-documented and serves as a valuable resource for understanding the algorithm, its implementation, and its applications in various machine learning tasks.

## Working Principle

### Training Phase:
KNN does not explicitly train a model. Instead, it stores the entire training dataset, which consists of input features and their corresponding output labels.

### Prediction Phase:
When presented with a new data point, KNN calculates the distance between the new point and all other points in the training dataset, typically using measures such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.

### Finding Neighbors:
It selects the K closest data points (nearest neighbors) based on the calculated distances.

### Classification or Regression:
For classification tasks, KNN assigns the class label that is most common among the K nearest neighbors. For regression tasks, it calculates the average of the target values of the K nearest neighbors.

## k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Implementation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-NN algorithm, covering both classification and regression aspects. You can find the following components within this implementation:

- **Classification**: K-NN for classification tasks, where the algorithm assigns a class label based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.

- **Regression**: K-NN for regression tasks, where the algorithm predicts a continuous value based on the average or weighted average of the k-nearest neighbors' target values.

- **Distance Metrics**: Various distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance, to measure the similarity between data points.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Techniques for selecting the optimal value of "K" and other hyperparameters.

## Key Considerations

The choice of K significantly impacts the performance of the algorithm. A small K value can lead to noise affecting the classification, while a large K value can cause oversmoothing, potentially mislabeling the data.

KNN is sensitive to the scale of the features, so it's essential to normalize or standardize the data before applying the algorithm.

KNN is computationally expensive during the prediction phase, especially in large datasets, as it requires calculating distances for each new data point.

## Applications

KNN is commonly used for pattern recognition, recommendation systems, and regression analysis.

It is suitable for both multi-class classification and regression tasks, making it a versatile algorithm in various domains.

KNN's simplicity and ability to handle both classification and regression tasks make it a popular choice for initial data analysis and as a benchmark for more complex algorithms in the field of machine learning.
